/*
Scope resolution operator
In computer programming, scope is an enclosing context where values
and expressions are associated. The scope resolution operator helps
to identify and specify the context to which an identifier refers,
particularly by specifying a namespace. The specific uses vary across
different programming languages with the notions of scoping. In many
languages the scope resolution operator is written "::".

In computing, a namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organize
objects of various kinds, so that these objects may be referred to by name.
Prominent examples include:

file systems are namespaces that assign names to files;[1]
some programming languages organize their variables and
subroutines in namespaces;[2][3][4]
computer networks and distributed systems assign names to resources,
such as computers, printers, websites, (remote) files, etc.
